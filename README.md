Hi, dude.
Here are some toys you can play with.
Hope you enjoy them.

1.dhclient-multiple.py
 
This is just an idea which came up to me to test dhcp servers.
You can see server offers and acks to every request.
Please use this in test environment.

2.dhcp-discover-request-inform.py

Useful tool to test DHCP server.

... more to come, hopefully.
